<!--more-->Press release ([pdf version](http://ochremusic.com/assets/epk/ochre-btol-press.pdf)):

This year sees Ochre (Christopher Leary) return with *Beyond
the Outer Loop*, his first full-length album since 2013's
*National Ignition*, following his *Isolette* EP in 2015.

*Beyond the Outer Loop* constitutes a refinement of Ochre's
trademark musicality, paring down his synthesiser-focused
arrangements without sacrificing the emotional and
melancholic style for which he is known. The album contrasts
from the upbeat, technical intricacy of opener 'Anaphora', to
the more pastoral tone of 'Rowing to the Riverhead' and
'Gilded Ground', as well as more minimal, almost choral
ambient pieces exemplified by 'Out of the Gyre' and 'Weak
Transponder'.

At the album's core, 'Suspension' is notable for its use of
vocals, weaving glossolalia into the fabric of ethereal,
fluttering synthesisers and an unwavering hiphop beat. Along
with 'Tourmaline', it typifies the more utopian, optimistic side
of the album, while 'Port Authority', 'Fenwick Colliery' and
'Light Rail' exhibit a darker and more urban, dystopian
unease.

As Leary himself explains, "As the album coalesced, I began
to draw a parallel between a narrative evoked by the music I
was writing, and the routes I would walk when taking a break
from the studio. My excursions out through the suburbs of
Newcastle, along the often detritus-laden trails, follow a
trajectory from constantly evolving, frenetic and noisy urban
environments, through brownfield areas littered with signs of
their industrial past, to the serene and expansive rural and
coastal destinations. It gave me a real sense of getting away
from the fumes and grit of my everyday surroundings, albeit
temporarily. I'd then hop on the train back to the city outskirts.
My music has always had a utopian melancholy at its core,
so it's perhaps unusual that I've ended up writing quite a
location-specific album."

*Beyond the Outer Loop* will be available on all major
streaming services and download stores from the 24th of
February, 2017.
