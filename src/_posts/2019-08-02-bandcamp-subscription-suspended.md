I've had to suspend my Bandcamp subscription temporarily in order to switch currencies. Sadly, this means previous subscribers will have to resubscribe manually after I reactivate it. This really stings, and I've been putting it off for as long as possible, but unfortunately there was just no way around it (I refuse to be nickel and dimed by PayPal's currency conversions, on top of their own payment fees, on top of Bandcamp's platform fees). But it'll be active once again soon, with new material to followâ€¦
