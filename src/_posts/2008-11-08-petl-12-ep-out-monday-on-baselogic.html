<p>New Ochre vinyl! It's been quite some time since I've had something out on vinyl, so I'm excited to announce the release of a new 12" EP, released on <a href="http://www.baselogic.net/">Baselogic</a>, on Monday (distributed by Veto). Here's the tracklist:</p>
<p>A1. Petl<br />
A2. Bass Recorder (a remix of Global Goon)<br />
B1. Neoretro<br />
B2. Chronon</p>
<p>Three of the four tracks have been available here on my site in the past, but I hope that won't dissuade you from grabbing a copy; it's been mastered at <a href="http://www.alchemysoho.com/html/index.php">Alchemy</a> to sound its best for its vinyl debut, so it ought to be no contest between mp3 and 12".</p>
<p>It's available to buy at the moment from <a href="http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=146016">Boomkat</a> and <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/334754-01.htm">Juno</a>, to ship on Monday. No doubt it will filter through the retail channel over the course of the week, but if your favourite store doesn't hold it, please ask them to order it in for you.</p>
<p>Edit: More stores: <a href="https://www.tempestrecords.co.uk/artists.php?artist=OCHRE">Tempest</a> (Brum, UK), <a href="http://www.phonicarecords.co.uk/detail.aspx?ID=33008">Phonica</a> (London), <a href="http://clone.nl/item13980.html">Clone</a> (Rotterdam, Netherlands), <a href="http://www.fenders.de/?search[artist]=OCHRE">Fat Fenders</a> (Dresden, Germany) <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&=&q=ochre+petl+ep&btnG=Google+Search&meta=">etc.</a></p>
<p>Like all other Baselogic releases, it will also be available digitally in due course. My remix of Ed Chamberlain is now available on mp3 from <a href="http://www.junodownload.com/products/1365889-02.htm">Juno</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IQQKOU/ref=dm_dp_trk4">Amazon</a>, Beatport and <a href="http://www.nuloop.com/en/mp3/detail/11133/ed_chamberlain_mixxy_ep_1.html">Nuloop</a>, with usual suspects Bleep and iTunes to follow.</p>
