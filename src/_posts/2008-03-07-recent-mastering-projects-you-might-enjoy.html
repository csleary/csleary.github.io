<p>Just a quickie: a couple of my recent <a href="http://ochremusic.com/mastering">mastering</a> projects might interest those who enjoy a bit of Boards of Canada-esque electronica (both of which are free to download, I might add).</p>
<p>First up is the new compilation on Twoism Records (borne out of the <a href="http://www.twoism.org/forum/index.php">Twoism</a> BoC community) called <a href="http://www.twoism.org/oneontwoism/2/audio/"><em>One on Twoism (Volume 2)</em></a>---yes, there's a One on Twoism Volume One too! Try saying that quickly.</p>
<p>Second up is the <a href="http://myuzyk.net/releases/Inspired-By-Boards-Of-Canada-MZYKNi002.php"><em>Inspired by... Boards of Canada: A Few New Tunes</em></a> release, on the budding <a href="http://myuzyk.net/">Myuzyk</a> netlabel. It's a bit more eclectic than the Twoism release, but still very much worth a listen.</p>
<p>Both releases are available in lossless FLAC too, as well as mp3! :cool:</p>
