Up until now I've been hesitant to switch on my [Bandcamp subscription](https://ochre.bandcamp.com/subscribe), as frankly I've been unsure whether or not I could offer enough material to make a rolling subscription worthwhile. But with numerous projects on the horizon (of which one will appear very soon) and an unearthed cache of live sets, I'm confident that I can keep subscribers happy for at least the next two or three years. :relieved:

At present, I've already uploaded six live sets as subscriber-exclusive rewards, with each set split into individually labelled tracks. If your music player is capable of gapless playback, then they should still play through seamlessly. Where possible I've included the original event flyer, but given that some of the events are over a decade old, I've not been able to find a complete set of flyers of suitably high resolution for Bandcamp. Should you happen to have any for the events available, please do let me know and I'll add them.

I'll continue to add extra live sets, one-offs and alternate versions, plus music from various projects that for whatever reason didn't make it to light. As an extra perk, all subscribers will receive a discount on physical formats and merchandise. Thanks for your support.
