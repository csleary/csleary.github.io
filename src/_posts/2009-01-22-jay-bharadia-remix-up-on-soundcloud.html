<p>If you haven't seen/heard my remix of Jay Bharadia, you can <a href="http://soundcloud.com/rufusbenjamin/jay-bharadia-little-boy-ochre-remix">listen to/download it from SoundCloud</a>, as well as the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/rufusbenjamin/sets/jay-bharadia-remixes">other remixes</a> from Lone, Airliner '67 and Implosion Quintet.</p>
<p>I'm actually on SoundCloud, and although currently mainly using it as a means of receiving mastering files, I'll be uploading demos and sketches now and then, so if you'd like to 'follow' me to be notified of track uploads, please <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre">visit my page</a>. SoundCloud is a very nifty service, totally optimised for listening and commenting to music---you can comment on particular sections of tracks using the natty timeline while listening. As far as I know there are also the obligatory widgets for posting/sharing tunes too.</p>
<p>The server can occasionally strain under the weight of users, as it's getting rather popular, but it seems pretty responsive these days, ironing out its initial teething problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at Ochre HQ, the new album is back from mastering, coutesy of <a href="http://panicstudios.com/">panicStudios</a>. Sounding warm and punchy after being fed through some ridiculously expensive analogue gear, waiting patiently for a release schedule to slot into. I'll be able to spill some more beans once I've got a definite plan to unveil.</p>
<p>Midsummer Nice Dream CDs and vinyl continue to shift nicely, but there are still <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">a few copies left</a> if you fancy one. If you'd rather have a download version, it's slowly making its way through the usual download stores like iTunes and Napster etc. At the moment it's currently selling for a ridiculously cheap $1.69 at <a href="http://amiestreet.com/music/ochre/a-midsummer-nice-dream/">Amie Street</a> (for 320kbps mp3, no less), though given the dynamic pricing used there it'll probably creep up slowly as people grab it. Also on <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.mu/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream">Bandcamp</a> for a flat $6, in just about every digital format available ever.</p>
<p>I think that's the current news round-up sorted.</p>
