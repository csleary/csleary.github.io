<p>I'm excited to announce that I'll soon be releasing a new EP, called <em>Isolette</em>, through the Netherlands-based <a href="http://www.shipwrec.org/">Shipwrec</a> imprint. Due on the 13th of January 2015, it will arrive on 12" vinyl plus download (UPDATE: the vinyl will be a week late, arriving on the 20th instead), featuring six tracks (including a remix by <a href="http://roelfuncken.com/">Roel Funcken</a>), plus a bonus download track. All vinyl purchases will come with a download code.</p>
<p>The artwork was expertly designed by <a href="http://nkurence.com/">nkurence</a>, and features some extra special ink finishes for the vinyl sleeve. It's been a while since I've had my music pressed on vinyl, so I can't wait to get my hands on these.</p>
