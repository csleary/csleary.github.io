<p>Yes, actually. Time for an autumnal sale! The AMND double 12" will be half-price, at just a fiver plus P&amp;P, at the <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">Ochre shop</a>. For a limited period of around a week, until I thereafter hopefully remember to put the prices up again.</p>
<p>All proceeds will go towards a CD repress of either AMND or Lemodie. Not sure which yet!</p>
