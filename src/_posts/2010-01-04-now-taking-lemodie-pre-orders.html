Well, some good news---<em>Lemodie</em> CDs will soon be back on the shelf.</p>
<p>At long last, after being out of print for over two years, I've finally managed to scrape together enough cash to organise a re-press of my 2006 sophomore album. It's being manufactured as I type by <a href="http://www.discmanufacturingservices.com/">DMS</a>, and shouldn't be longer than two or three weeks away, fingers crossed.</p>
<p>In preparation of its arrival, I'm taking pre-orders via Bandcamp <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/lemodie">here</a>, which also covers an instant download in a variety of formats (I've also thrown in the CD hidden track as a bonus).</p>
<p>Now, I'm under no illusions as to how the market has changed in the past three/four years, and so have set the price at Â£6 plus P&amp;P, which seems to me like the sweet-spot for CDs sans middleman.</p>
