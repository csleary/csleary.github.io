<p>After a few late nights spent tinkering with the inner-workings of my site, I'm pleased to inaugurate the new <a href="http://ochremusic.com/music">Ochre Download Store</a>! It's basically an extension of the previous music page; in addition to the usual free downloads, you now have the option of purchasing 320kbps mp3s and <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">FLAC</a>s of each track. I've been wanting to offer better quality versions of the tracks for quite a while now, so I'm glad to be able to offer some lossless CD-quality FLACs of each track for the first time. Hopefully I'll be able to cover the costs of the store, which is powered by <a href="http://www.e-junkie.com">E-Junkie</a>.</p>
<p>I've priced the individual 320kbps mp3s at $0.79 (~£0.40) and the FLACs at $0.99 (~£0.50), which I hope is reasonable, given their quality. For extra savings, you can purchase a bundle containing the whole lot for $15 (mp3) and $20 (FLAC). Payment at the moment is via PayPal, though you don't need an account to pay---you can simply enter your credit card information in directly. Once you've paid, you'll be presented with your download links, which will also be emailed to you.</p>
<p>Of course, you're still welcome to download the full mp3s for free, and although the quality is limited to 128kbps 22.05kHz, this should be enough to still enjoy the music on portable players etc.</p>
<p>So, please test the store, make sure everything works, and <a href="http://ochremusic.com/contact">let me know</a> if you come across any bugs, or have any suggestions. :)</p>
