<p>Last year San Diego-based games developer <a href="http://www.psyonix.com/">Psyonix</a> got in touch about licensing a couple of tracks in a tech demo/game called <a href="http://www.udk.com/showcase-whizzle.html">Whizzle</a>, showcasing the Unreal Development Kit. Being a demo, it's just a single level (for now, at least), but I'm glad it came to fruition nonetheless. Here's a short vid of Whizzle in action:</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning more about the UDK and fancy dipping your toes into the world of game development, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8ymbUmI36g">this video</a> of Dave at Psyonix gives you a quick intro to the platform. The UDK is free to download too, so given a little free time there's nothing stopping you from crafting your own titles.</p>
