<p>A few weeks ago I completed scoring this charming animated short called 'Dresslocked'. It was the final year project for talented Teesside animation student Domareen Fox, and allowed me to break in a few new sound libraries, as well as record plenty of sound effects and foley work. I'm always up for more of this kind of work, so please get in touch if you'd like me to score your film/game project.</p>
