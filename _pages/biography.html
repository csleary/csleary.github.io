<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>
  Ochre is the work of Christopher Leary, currently based in The Hague, Netherlands. He has been
  crafting intricately melodic music since 2001, and has released on Toytronic, Benbecula Records,
  Village Green, Tramworks, Shipwrec and Lapsus, in addition to his own
  <em>Aura Materia</em> imprint.
</p>
<p>
  Stylistically, his music is often highly melodic, described by the NME as being “full of
  shimmering electronics, crunchy, crispy beats and sweeping melancholic melodies that recall
  classic electronic stars such as Boards Of Canada,” with “analogue tones and glitchy beats &ndash;
  snatches of classical orchestration are peppered throughout, helping to create rich cinematic
  soundscapes.”<sup>1</sup>

  under the &lsquo;Vellyn&rsquo; pseudonym.

  Leary is occasionally commissioned to compose music for film and television, and scored the
  award-winning animated documentary, <em>Centrefold</em>, as well as animator Domareen Fox’s
  award-winning animated short, <em>Dresslocked</em>.

  Outside of his own musical ventures, Leary has operated his independent mastering service,
  Melograf Mastering, since 2009. In 2012 he completed a practice-led PhD in music at the University
