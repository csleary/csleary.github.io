<p>Designer <a href="http://nkurence.com">Nate Reeves</a> has knocked up a very cool intricate and flowing Ochre logo, which he then sent to a bespoke engraving outfit to produce a very tasty 3D laser-engraved skateboard deck, with the detailed Ochre logo embossed across it. How cool is that? Talk about a unique artefact. Along with the Ochre logo, he sent a couple of other designs along with it for the same treatment, such as his artwork for <a href="http://naritarecords.com/">Narita</a>'s final <em>Terminal</em> compilation, and a third design of his own.</p>

      <p>Minor rant ahead. Last week I pulled the plug on my MySpace page, though admittedly not without a certain amount of hesitation and deliberation---it took a long time to amass those hard-earned 120k plays after all, that's for sure. But, once I thought about the ridiculous valuations MySpace has bewilderingly managed to achieve on the back of advertising potential (not to mention the many millions of penniless and uncompensated musicians bolstering its value), as well as its corporate bedfellows, I felt a little better about ditching it.<br />

      <p>Just a final reminder that I'll be closing the mastering service and shop before the end of the week, until August, as I'll be off to concentrate on my thesis work over the summer. I've got 7 Midsummer Nice Dream CDs left in stock, which would be nice to clear; considerably more vinyl is available, so don't worry about that -- plenty left. If you need any odd tracks mastered, please arrange to get them to me by Wednesday at the latest, just so I've got a couple of days to work on them and get them back to you.</p>
<p>I'll still be online around here though and obviously contactable via email---not going to leave the face of the planet while I've got an impending album release.</p>

<p>Yep, my next album 'Like Dust of the Balance', is now available to <a href="http://www.benbecula.com/buy.shtml">pre-order</a> directly from Benbecula, to ship on the 20th of July. It's quite far off, I'll admit, but then if you order early enough you'll have long forgotten by the time its release rolls around, and you can surprise your future self with a gift.</p>

      <p>Just a quick note -- my mastering service will be put on hold from the end of the month until the beginning of August, as I'll be away from the studio for a while. So, if you envisage needing my services over the next few weeks, then please get in touch ASAP to see if I can fit you in before the summer break. Once I return, the service will be back with a vengeance, hopefully with some exciting new toys to play with.</p>

      <p>As I’m sure we’re all aware, playing electronic music live is often fraught with difficulties and conundrums: how do I recreate studio tracks, yet remain spontaneous? Should I even bother recreating studio tracks? How can I balance the familiar with the improvised? How can I be more interesting, <a href="http://www.deadact.com/">visually</a>? And that’s just the choices that will be reflected on stage. Never mind the logistical nightmares of hauling half your studio, fragile laptops, hardware synths, keyboards, and equipment stands around a foreign city without injuring yourself or your gear, getting lost, or getting stuff stolen.

<p>The track is 'Lunar Suburbia,' taken from the next Ochre album, 'Like Dust of the Balance,' playing through an old hard disk soldered up to the headphone outputs of my sound card.</p>
<p>Yep, it sounds terrible. But looking at the little drive head vibrate and bob in time with the music perhaps redeems it a little.</p>
<p>If you fancy making your own hard disk speaker, there are a few articles dotted around the net documenting the process, step-by-step, such as the one at the ever-handy <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hard-Drive-Speaker-System/">Instructables</a>.</p>

<p>I've decided to take advantage of one of Bandcamp's latest feature additions, and have generated a few download codes for <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream">A Midsummer Nice Dream</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">buys a copy</a> of the album on vinyl will receive a download code along with the album, so they may download a high-quality digital version of the release for their iPod, car, PC etc., at no extra cost. The codes are, as far as I can tell, good for one single download only, so choose your format wisely! mp3, flac, aac and ogg are all present and accounted for.</p>
<p>I haven't yet decided how to present the codes -- I could use stickers on the shrink-wrap, but risk buyers throwing this away with the packaging, or I could put paper slips in with the vinyl, and risk them being ignored at the bottom of the envelope. Could email them, but that's more work for me and could still be ignored. Hmm. Any preferences?</p>

      <p>EDIT: Limited-time demo removed.</p>
<p>I've just uploaded a new track demo, following a tentative test-airing on the kind and gentle folks at em411. It's a little different to my usual output, actually containing intelligible vocals, and due to my vocal delivery probably has a slight eighties tinge to it. (That makes it hip, right? Or am I 18 months late to that luminous yellow and pink party?) So far I've been called a Bowie-esque crooner with hint of David Sylvian, Gary Numan '09, and somewhat damningly, Flock of Seagulls.</p>
<p>Dissenters rest assured, I don't plan to abandon instrumental electronica any time soon, but I will say that this was a lot of fun to record. I kind of want to put out a 7" with a couple of synthpoppier tracks on it.</p>

<p>I'm actually on SoundCloud, and although currently mainly using it as a means of receiving mastering files, I'll be uploading demos and sketches now and then, so if you'd like to 'follow' me to be notified of track uploads, please <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre">visit my page</a>. SoundCloud is a very nifty service, totally optimised for listening and commenting to music---you can comment on particular sections of tracks using the natty timeline while listening. As far as I know there are also the obligatory widgets for posting/sharing tunes too.</p>
<p>The server can occasionally strain under the weight of users, as it's getting rather popular, but it seems pretty responsive these days, ironing out its initial teething problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at Ochre HQ, the new album is back from mastering, coutesy of <a href="http://panicstudios.com/">panicStudios</a>. Sounding warm and punchy after being fed through some ridiculously expensive analogue gear, waiting patiently for a release schedule to slot into. I'll be able to spill some more beans once I've got a definite plan to unveil.</p>
<p>Midsummer Nice Dream CDs and vinyl continue to shift nicely, but there are still <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">a few copies left</a> if you fancy one. If you'd rather have a download version, it's slowly making its way through the usual download stores like iTunes and Napster etc. At the moment it's currently selling for a ridiculously cheap $1.69 at <a href="http://amiestreet.com/music/ochre/a-midsummer-nice-dream/">Amie Street</a> (for 320kbps mp3, no less), though given the dynamic pricing used there it'll probably creep up slowly as people grab it. Also on <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.mu/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream">Bandcamp</a> for a flat $6, in just about every digital format available ever.</p>
<p>I think that's the current news round-up sorted.</p>
