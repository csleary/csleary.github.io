<p>Featuring <del datetime="2013-12-24T20:47:06+00:00">122</del> 123 tracks of music (over 11 hours!) from a mix of electronica veterans and newcomers, 'Touched' is a massive charity compilation set up by Martin Boulton, whose mother was recently diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>All proceeds will go to Macmillan Cancer Support, which is a charity providing essential palliative care and support for cancer sufferers. After hearing friends describe just how valuable Macmillan were to them and their loved ones, it's clear to me just how important and worthy a cause this is. So, needless to say, I was more than happy to contribute a new track: 'Ark of Comfort'.</p>
<p>The album has already raised over £500 in its first day of release, and given it's offering so much music for as little as £6, I anticipate that it'll raise a whole lot more. Still, if electronic music's not your thing, but you'd still like to donate, you can do so directly via the <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/Touched-Music">'Touched' Just Giving page</a> instead.</p>
