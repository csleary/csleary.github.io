<p>Following some digital broker misunderstandings, the details of which I shall not bore you, Lemodie is back on iTunes. If you've got iTunes installed on your computer, you can hop straight to Lemodie <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=274000983&s=143444">here</a>.</p>
<p>While I'm on the subject of downloads, <a href="http://www.rednetic.net">Rednetic Recordings</a> have updated their site with a swanky new download store, so you can now, for example, grab mp3 copies of my tracks <em>Valley Forge</em> and <em>Reverse Engineering</em> from the <a href="http://www.rednetic.net?hl=releases;I;16">One Point One</a> compilation, should you so wish. ;)</p>
