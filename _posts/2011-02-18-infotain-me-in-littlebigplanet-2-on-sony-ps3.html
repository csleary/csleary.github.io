<p>The sequel to Sony's popular <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> game has finally been released on PS3. Developed once again by the talented folks of <a href="http://www.mediamolecule.com">Media Molecule</a>), <a href="http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/2/">LittleBigPlanet 2</a> is touted as not merely a platform game, but a platform <em>for</em> games, allowing players to create their own games, levels and music.</p>
<p>My track 'Infotain Me', taken from <em><a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/lemodie">Lemodie</a></em>, was licensed for use as part of the in-game soundtrack within LittleBigPlanet 2, and features alongside tracks from the likes of Plaid and Squarepusher. Needless to say, I was thrilled to be involved.</p>
