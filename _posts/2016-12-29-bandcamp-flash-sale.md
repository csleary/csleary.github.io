I thought I'd run a little Bandcamp flash sale for the few remaining days of this year. If you fancy saving 50% on anything from [my Bandcamp store](http://bandcamp.ochremusic.com/), please hurry over and use the code `16end50` at the checkout to lop your cart total in half (excepting P&P, obviously). You'll have until the fireworks are ignited. :fireworks:
