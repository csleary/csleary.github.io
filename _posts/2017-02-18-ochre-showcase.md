Martin Boulton, of [Touched Music](http://touched.isig.co/) fame, has very kindly decided to curate a two-hour showcase of my music on [Mixlr](http://mixlr.com/touched-music/), this Thursday evening at 8pm GMT (i.e. the night before my new album's release).

The showcase will feature a few lesser-known tracks and remixes, some choice picks from my back catalogue, plus a couple of tracks from the new album. Feel free to swing by!

There's an [event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1257154387701783/) for it on Facebook.
