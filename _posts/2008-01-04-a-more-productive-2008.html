<p>If I had to profess some sort of New Year's resolution, it would probably be along the lines of 'be more productive.' So, apologies for the radio silence over the past couple of months or so; I've been pretty much occupied by some festive employment, which will thankfully draw to a close this weekend. I'd like to think that from then on I'll be a little more forthcoming with blog updates and future project information.</p>
<p>But just to let you know I haven't been completely idle, as apart from the Ed Chamberlain remix, I've also been collaborating with the industrious multi-instrumentalist Benet Walsh, whose name you may recognise in electronica circles from his work with Plaid (providing guitar for the tracks <em>Ralome</em> and <em>Eyen</em>, among others). Hopefully we'll have penned a couple more tracks together, in addition to those we've already completed, for release at some point this year.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://ochremusic.com/mastering/">mastering</a> side of business, I've been enjoying some rich and varied projects ranging from Gaelic laments to experimental ambient, house and metal---hopefully this will continue through 2008!</p>
