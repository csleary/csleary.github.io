<p>255 generous artists have contributed to what amounts to almost a day's worth of music, in aid of the Macmillan Cancer Support charity, all for the meagre sum of Â£12+. Buy <a href="http://touched.bandcamp.com/album/touched-two">here</a>. I've contributed a new track: 'Rowing to the Riverhead'.</p>
