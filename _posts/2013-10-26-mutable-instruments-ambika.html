<p>Been enjoying this little project, spending the past week building a <a href="http://mutable-instruments.net/">Mutable Instruments</a> Ambika for a friend. Digital wavetable oscillators with 4-pole analogue filters, like the basic Shruthi, but with 6-voice polyphony. Brimming with character, and serious bang for buck if you can handle a soldering iron. Just don't get hung up about about the aliasing, as it's all part of the charm. Shall endeavour to get some sound online soon.</p>
