<p>This remix medley of mine, based on various themes taken from Nintendo's <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game franchise, seems to pop up now and then on the radar of various blogs, so I thought it might be useful to offer a few notes about the circumstances under which it was written. Although I'm a huge fan of the franchise, with many happy memories playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past"><em>Zelda: A Link to the Past</em></a> on my SNES, the remix didn't come about purely as a celebration of the game and its music; it was written for a 2003  competition (I think it was 2003 anyway -- my memory's pretty hazy) hosted by UK games mag Computer and Video Games, and sponsored by Nintendo and  Turnkey (a chain of UK music stores). The possibility of winning a Gamecube bundled with Zelda: Wind Waker, plus an <a href="http://www.access-music.de/products.php4?product=indigo2">Access Virus Indigo 2</a> VA synth, was too good to pass up. So over the course of one weekend I set about writing a little remix medley homage to the music of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrule">Hyrule</a>.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, after completely forgetting about the competition, I got a phone call a few months later, from one of the competition organisers notifying me of my win, and a couple of days later I received the Gamecube and Access Virus, feeling like an excited kid on Christmas morning. Somewhat regretfully, I then sold the Virus a month or so after, as at the time I was wholly convinced VSTi synths were all I'd ever need (oops), and that the proceeds of the synth would be better spent purchasing another <a href="http://www.uaudio.com/products/uad-dsp_menu.html">UAD-1</a> DSP card, as they were a just couple of hundred quid short of a grand at the time. Ah well, at least I still have the Gamecube (mostly used for Mario Kart!).</p>
