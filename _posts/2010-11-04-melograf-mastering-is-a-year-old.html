<p>Goodness me, that was quick. It just recently occurred to me that my sister-venture, <a href="http://melograf.com/">Melograf Mastering</a>, has survived its first year formally in business. I can still recall the trepidation I felt when I first set about completing the paperwork. But, thanks to the help of some very kind friends, plus of course the clients who have entrusted me with their music over the course of the year (a good start -- over a hundred projects), it's been a great first year.</p>
<p>The procurement of a set of ADDA convertors last week (to join my lone monitoring DA) was clearly an unconscious celebration of this feat. Time to start thinking about some choice outboard for the new analogue loop.</p>
