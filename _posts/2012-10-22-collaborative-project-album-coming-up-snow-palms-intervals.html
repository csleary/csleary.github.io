David's a composer of beautiful minimal, idiophone-based music in a similar vein to Reich, Glass et al, so I couldn't resist the opportunity to add my own production flourishes to some of the tracks he'd laid down, working on six of the eleven album tracks in the end. I also got to score for a string quartet, which isn't something I regularly get to do, so that was quite the welcome challenge.</p>
<p>A review of the album surfaced today on <a href="http://www.fluid-radio.co.uk/2012/10/snow-palms-intervals/">Fluid Radio</a> -- check it out to read a take on what we've done (though for whatever reason, I'm not mentioned there -- I'm involved, I promise!).</p>
<p>It's due for release on 19th of November. For more info/press copy and audio excerpts, please visit the release page on <a href="http://www.villagegreen.tv/#project_intervals_45">Village Green</a>.</p>
