<p>I've just added some gorgeous new heavyweight print bundles to Bandcamp for <a href="https://ochre.bandcamp.com/merch/ltd-heavyweight-matte-print-digital-album-2">Isolette</a>, <a href="https://ochre.bandcamp.com/merch/ltd-heavyweight-matte-print-digital-album">National Ignition</a> and <a href="https://ochre.bandcamp.com/merch/ltd-heavyweight-matte-print-digital-album-3">Early Learning</a> -- a complete set of nkurence-designed album art.</p>
<p>Each print is just under twelve inches square in size (fitting nicely in a vinyl sleeve), has been digitally printed on thick 300gsm matte stock, and comes with an instant Bandcamp download in the format of your choice.</p>
<p>For those who don't want vinyl, it's still a great way to enjoy an element of physicality with your music, not to mention they'll also look stunning framed on the wall.</p>
<p>All the physical items I have for sale can be seen my <a href="https://ochre.bandcamp.com/merch">Bandcamp merch page</a>.</p>
