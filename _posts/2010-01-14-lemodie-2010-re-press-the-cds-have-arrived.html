<p>Nothing quite like opening your front door, wearing your dressing gown and slippers, to be met with disdain by a burly delivery man already four hours into his working day. Nice. Shortly after he'd finished looking me up and down with barely-disguised contempt, and informing me of eight boxes with my name on it, I was proudly standing in my hallway wondering where I could store 800 CDs.</p>
<p>I've already annoyed the staff and patrons in the local Post Office by shipping the dozen or so pre-orders, so they are now well on their way to their new homes! A big thanks is in order to everyone who pre-ordered -- I hope you received your instant downloads trouble-free (you've got to love Bandcamp!).</p>
<p>As usual, I've also sent a bundle of Lemodies to <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/Ochre">CD Baby</a>, to make the postal fees a little easier on the pocket for US fans. I've added them to my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lemodie-Ochre/dp/B000GCGA4C">Amazon</a> seller account too, so if you'd prefer to order through Amazon's checkout you're free to do that (though you'll have to put up with a slightly higher price and no download). Speaking of Amazon, if anyone wouldn't mind dropping a quick review there, I'd hugely appreciate it (for any of my releases, not just Lemodie).</p>
<p>Anyway, I've ceremoniously updated the html in <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">my shop</a> to mark this momentous occasion, and hereby declare Lemodie in stock and on sale. :)</p>
