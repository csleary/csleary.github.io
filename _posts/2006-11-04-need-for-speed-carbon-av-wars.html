<p>Recently, I've been working on editing and remixing the audio for one of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=NFSAVWars">VJ collaborations</a> to be featured on Need For Speed: Carbon, EA's latest installment of the popular gaming franchise. Six visual artists were commissioned to create short animations inspired by the game, and were supplied with suitable raw materials (videos, images, models etc) to use, should they wish. A friend of mine and long-time Ochre collaborator <a href="http://www.platform01.com">Patrick Ehrlund</a> was selected to create one of the animations, electing to create a 3D animation from scratch rather than remix the supplied media, with me editing and remixing the existing project audio to fit the animation more closely. It's a shame YouTube totally throws the tight audio-visual timing out the window, but here's what we came up with:</p>
<div align="center"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UfaZ3vXPpuA" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UfaZ3vXPpuA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></div>
<p>All six animations will be included on the collectors edition of Need For Speed: Carbon, and are also doing the rounds on TV ad breaks (at least here in the UK). Keep an eye out for the ad and press the red button on your Sky remote to check them all out.</p>
