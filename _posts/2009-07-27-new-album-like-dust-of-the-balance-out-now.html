<p>Along with my previous albums, you can stream the whole thing in its entirety <a href="http://ochremusic.com/music/">here</a>, and can purchase downloads through <a href="http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&releaseid=20752">Bleep</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Like-Dust-of-the-Balance/dp/B002I2WRRM/">Amazon mp3</a>, with iTunes et al following whenever they get round to it. If you missed out on Lemodie CDs, Bleep now has Lemodie <a href="http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&releaseid=20965">available in lossless wav</a>, for a proper CD-quality download. I had hoped for a repress, but as Benbecula are <a href="http://www.benbecula.com">closing their doors</a> in November, that’s probably now not going to happen.</p>
<p>As for ‘Like Dust’ CDs, your best bet at the moment is to order directly from Benbecula, though I’ve noticed <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk/products/356127-01.htm">Juno</a>, <a href="http://www.normanrecords.com/records/108190">Norman Records</a> and <a href="http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&sku=314454">Rough Trade</a> also have it up for sale. Hopefully the CDs will filter through the usual retail outlets in time, but as it was with Lemodie, distribution is expected to be somewhat spotty for a while.</p>
<p><em>A Midsummer Nice Dream</em> CDs have now completely sold out; if there's sufficient demand for a repress, I'll organise one down the road at some point.</p>
<p>The Ochre <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">tees and hoodies</a> have been selling quite nicely, and I've added some more designs for the fairer sex too. Send me some pictures of you wearing your Ochre threads and I'll put up a gallery of the best ones.</p>
