<p>A new track of mine, <em>Zome City</em>, was released yesterday on Barcelona's Lapsus Records, featuring on their <em>DEU</em> compilation, available on red vinyl and download. The compilation contains 17 tracks, from artists such as Plaid (vinyl-exclusive, sadly), Kelpe, Vector Lovers, and many more.</p>
<p>I've been playing a tweaked version of Zome City in my latest live set (skip to 08:50 in the Utrecht recording posted a week or so ago if you're curious to compare the two), and find having a track on vinyl to be a satisfying closure to the production process---something I've really missed with the download releases, as it's been a while since my last vinyl release. Looking forward to seeing some more new music on vinyl this year!</p>
