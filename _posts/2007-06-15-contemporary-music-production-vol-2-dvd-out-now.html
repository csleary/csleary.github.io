<p>I've kindly been featured in the <a href="http://www.contemporarymusicproduction.com/SerTwo.html">second volume</a> of the <a href="http://www.contemporarymusicproduction.com">Contemporary Music Production</a> series of DVDs, alongside Bookashade, DJ Vadim, Max Richter and Trentemoller, all giving away our production techniques, tips and tricks, offering insight into our respective approach to the music we create. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iRZoxFbO3k">Here's a snippet</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.contemporarymusicproduction.com/SerOne.html">first volume</a> featured Murcof, Isolee, Richard X, Philip Clemo and Transparent Sound, and is also well worth <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vafKuw4LXI">checking out</a>. Both volumes can be purchased directly through the <a href="http://www.contemporarymusicproduction.com">CMP site</a> and <a href="http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=37168">selected retailers</a>.</p>
