<p>Just a final reminder that I'll be closing the mastering service and shop before the end of the week, until August, as I'll be off to concentrate on my thesis work over the summer. I've got 7 Midsummer Nice Dream CDs left in stock, which would be nice to clear; considerably more vinyl is available, so don't worry about that -- plenty left. If you need any odd tracks mastered, please arrange to get them to me by Wednesday at the latest, just so I've got a couple of days to work on them and get them back to you.</p>
<p>I'll still be online around here though and obviously contactable via email---not going to leave the face of the planet while I've got an impending album release.</p>
