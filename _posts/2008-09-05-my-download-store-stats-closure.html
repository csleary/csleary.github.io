<p>Well, it was a fun experiment for the past six months, setting up a download store for my unreleased music. But following the removal of a few tunes for an upcoming release, I've decided I'd rather have more people listen to my music than have a little extra pocket money, so I've reverted to giving everything away for free (still in 320kbps mp3 and FLAC formats).</p>
<p>For those curious about the kind of money I was making with the store, here are some stats: Since launch, 56 generous souls purchased music from the store, with 120 items sold in total, earning me about Â£299 (minus the monthly E-Junkie service plan fee and PayPal charges). Not a bad run for a musical nobody such as myself.</p>
<p>Hopefully the disclosure of my sales information doesn't come off sounding either like a complaint or a boast---just keeping you all in the loop. Thanks very much to everyone who stumped-up for the downloads; the warm fuzzy feeling you must have felt supporting independent music will have hopefully made up for the slight annoyance of seeing it all freely available again.</p>
<p>In an altogether non-unrelated subject, <a href="http://www.musicthinktank.com/blog/please-buy-my-record-the-futility-of-flogging-music.html">this little read</a> and the subsequent discussion may provide some entertainment. As a die-hard cynic I couldn't help but revel in its unrelenting, though thoroughly entertaining, pessimism. Certainly brought up a few smiles reading it, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Well, I'll limp on, musically, trying my damnedest to get this album finished before 2010...</p>
