<p>For those of you who were interested in hearing my very early works, I've added tracks from my 2001 demo CD, <em>AudioMicroDevice</em>, to the <a href="http://ochremusic.com/music">music page</a>, completely remastered, with high quality versions also available for purchase. I guess it's the first time for almost eight years that these tracks are available in genuine lossless CD-quality, too.</p>
<p>AudioMicroDevice was originally given away to anyone who asked, and while the tracklist varied a bit depending on what I was writing at the time, I'm quite sure I've managed to collect all the tracks from the CD's various permutations (the <a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/669148">discogs listing</a> is pretty much accurate). Some of the tracks went on to be released on <em>A Midsummer Nice Dream</em>, others though various compilations, and so couldn't be included here; I'm just filling in the gaps, making the long-lost material available for those who are curious, for a bit of fun.</p>
<p>Stylistically, it's pretty varied stuff, written before I'd actually settled into any kind of musical identity; some of the tracks were actually college coursework pieces, which might account for the scattered nature of the CD.</p>
<p>Hope a track or two catches your ear, anyway. :)</p>
