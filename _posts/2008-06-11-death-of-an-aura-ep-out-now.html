<p>I'm pleased to finally be able to say that my new download EP, <em>Death of an Aura</em>, is now available for preview/purchase on <a href="http://www.bleep.com/?bleep=BEN039">Bleep</a>. FLAC versions should be following shortly; I'll be updating this post, as well as the discog page, with links to additional stores as and when store support improves.</p>
<p>Musically, I suppose you could say the EP features my vocal debut, albeit mainly through humming and oohing/ahhing here and there for a bit of extra texture, with additional non-lyrics for good measure. Still, I did find the process a lot of fun, adding an immediacy that's normally lacking from my usual methodical composing. Lots of home sampling too, which is certainly something I only really touched upon with Lemodie, and completely ignored with AMND.</p>
<p>A couple of tracks ('Napoli' and 'Raido') are the result of a collaboration between Benet Walsh and I (you may recognise Benet from his work with Plaid, as well as his own work as one half of The Collectors), which were fantastic to work on. Hopefully we'll get a few more tracks done together by the time the album arrives---thanks for the help, Ben!</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy it. :) Let me know what you think, and please---if you can spread the word across any forums or communities you participate in, I'd very much appreciate it.</p>
