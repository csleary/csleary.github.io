<p>I've been uploading much of my music to <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.mu/">Bandcamp</a>, to see how well it works, as it offers a few very handy features for precisely zero money (for the time being anyway).</p>
<p>Firstly, the lossless uploads are automatically converted to a veritable plethora of download formats, such as three grades of mp3 (including two VBR), two grades of AAC, Ogg, FLAC and Apple Lossless.</p>
<p>Secondly, it gives me some useful stats as to what's been listened to, what's been skipped, and where people have come from to listen. There's also plenty of widget-sharing options, as expected on today's internets, enabling you to plaster my tunes all over the superhighweb.</p>
<p>Looks like you can also sell downloads there as well, offering either fixed price or donation options for the tracks, but I've yet to explore this option. Might give this a go once I get some more releases up there.</p>
