<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/462517067181883/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Mindcamp-209x300.jpg" alt="Mindcamp" width="209" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1864" /></a>It's been almost six years since I last did a gig, so it's not without a little trepidation that I'm announcing a couple of gigs over the next week in the Netherlands. Both shows are Mindcamp events, organised by Dutch IDM veterans Funckarma. I'll be playing alongside the Raster Noton artist <a href="http://www.raster-noton.net/main.php?action=artists&dat=102">Grischa Lichtenberger</a>, with visual support from Videotroopers, plus tunes from the Mindcamp DJs. Tickets for both events are an extremely reasonable â‚¬5. Should be a moderately chilled affair. I've been told there'll be tasty vegan food on offer, too!</p>
<p>The first takes place late on Friday 21st March (2200-0200) at the Merleyn venue in Nijmegen (<a href="http://www.doornroosje.nl/agenda/3228/ochre-grischa-lichtenberger-mindcamp-dj-s-vj-videotroopers">tickets</a>). Here's the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/410340755778607/">event page on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The second will be on Sunday 23rd, during the afternoon (1500+) at Tivoli Spiegelbar in Utrecht (<a href="http://www.tivoli.nl/agenda/3962/Mindcamp">tickets</a>). <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/462517067181883/">Event page</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be putting my new live rig through its paces, which should be interesting. It's primarily Ableton and a Push controller, plus a little Faderfox sidecar for when I want to switch effects without having to switch modes on the Push. So far it seems quite flexible, allowing me to tap out synth melodies, trigger clips and adjust effects, all without having to keep my eyes constantly planted on the laptop screen. This time around I've managed to run a lot more of the synth elements live (some of the tracks are entirely live-generated), so hopefully it'll sound and feel pretty live. There'll be plenty of errant notes to reassure you that I'm actually playing live, is what I'm saying.</p>
