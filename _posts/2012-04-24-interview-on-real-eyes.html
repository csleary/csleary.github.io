<p>There's a nice little interview with me currently running at <a href="http://www.realeyesonline.net/"><em>Real Eyes</em></a> [<a href="http://www.realeyesonline.net/music/ochre/">direct link</a>]. As well as featuring excerpts from our dialogue, the article also includes quotes from previous interviews I've done (it's always odd reading old interviews; "did I really say that?"). Anyway, it makes for a nice primer on what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and where I've come from.</p>
<p>While you're there, you may as well catch the interview with Hecq, too!</p>
