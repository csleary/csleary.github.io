<p>A couple of you were asking about the surround version of Reception (see <a href="http://ochremusic.com/2008/03/03/av-festival-broadcast/">here</a> for more info), so here it is:</p>

<p>Working in surround is still somewhat of a novelty for me, and I'm sure I've yet to get to grips fully with it, so let me know if you hear anything that sounds like it shouldn't be there and I'll make appropriate adjustments.</p>
