<p>Firstly, a little notice. There are a handful of <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/merch/ltd-heavyweight-matte-print-digital-album">'National Ignition' heavyweight prints</a> remaining, so if you've been thinking about grabbing one, now's the time. Once they're gone, they're gone. Each print comes with an instant download, too.</p>

Entitled <a href="https://www.facebook.com/touchedmusic">'Touched'</a>, the compilation is a huge bumper release featuring many familiar names within the electronica milieu, including many favourites of mine, such as The Future Sound of London, Plaid, Brothomstates, Arovane, Datassette, and dozens more (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/touched-music-for-macmillan-cancer-support/confirmed-artists-so-far/660793160619081">here's the full line-up</a>). It's a staggering compilation, with the aim of raising money for <a href="http://www.macmillan.org.uk/">Macmillan Cancer Support</a>. It's a wonderful cause to be a part of, and I can't wait to announce its release.</p>
<p>Please help spread the word, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/touchedmusic">like the Facebook page</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/touched_music">follow on Twitter</a>, and stay tuned!</p>
