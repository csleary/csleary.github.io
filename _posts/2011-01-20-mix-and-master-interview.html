<p>Oleg Mokhov, co-founder of net radio station <a href="http://bluerize.com/">BlueRize</a>, was kind enough to host a Skype interview with me recently for his <a href="http://bluerize.com/mixandmaster">Mix &amp; Master</a> show.</p>
<p>Over the course of the interview we discuss how my burgeoning mastering business, Melograf Mastering, got off the ground, as well as getting into the logistical nuts and bolts of its everyday operation. Itâ€™s quite an extensive interview, and as such is split into two parts. The first covers why and how I decided to set up Melograf, with the second part following next week, covering the actual audio processing minutia and associated geekery. You can stream the first part <a href="http://bluerize.com/mix-and-master-002-ochre-interview-part-1-on-starting-your-music-business">here</a>.</p>
