<p>I've just set up my own little <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">shop</a> selling odd stock of my past releases, such as A Midsummer Nice Dream on vinyl for just £6 plus P&amp;P. I hope to get the odd limited release up there too, so please keep your eyes peeled for the odd one-off relic from the Ochre archives.</p>
<p>Due to the way the shopping cart works (in this case, the <a href="http://www.fatfreecart.com/">FatFreeCart</a>) in not catering for multiple shipping fees, I've set out separate purchase buttons depending on the shipping destination, with P&amp;P prices ranging from £3 in the UK to £4 for EU customers and £6 for US. Yes, shipping vinyl is rather steep, so I've kept the base unit price down to around half of the usual retail price.</p>
<p>I've also been toying with the idea of releasing some of my unreleased 'Volumes' or 'AMD' on CD---would this be of any interest to you? I'll see how feasible a short run of CDs will be and possibly get some up if there's suitable interest.</p>
