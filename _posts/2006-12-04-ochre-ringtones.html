<p>Yes, it finally happened - you can now officially <a href="http://www.awesome-tones.com/catalog.php?id=5&c_id=61">put Mobile Foes on your phone</a>, and allow everyone at the bus stop to bask in your well-informed musical tastes. Five variations of Mobile Foes are on offer, in addition to four Ochre-penned retro tones, for those who mourn the days of monochromatic phone displays and gloriously tinny phone sound chips.</p>
