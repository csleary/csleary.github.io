In an effort to rescue [a few Lemodie CDs](https://store.cdbaby.com/cd/Ochre2) sitting in CD Baby's warehouse, I've dropped the price to \$5. Should they not sell quickly enough, they'll be sent away for recycling, which would be a shame after paying to ship them across the Atlantic. I'd rather avoid this pointless manufacture/demanufacture cycle and have it actually reach someone's music collection instead.
