<p>And <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ochre/190149549210">it needs you</a>! Yes, I know you may have already done this (and I do apologise for the inconvenience), but it'd be awfully nice of you to click on it again.</p>
<p>Following my traditional of sporadic and occasionally regrettable social media suicides, I had removed my Facebook profile after inadvertently hosing the Ochre page (I thought it would be 'hibernating' along with my personal profile, but I guess not!). Now while I'm not missing MySpace, Facebook was a much handier means of getting snippets of news updates out there, and although Twitter has become increasingly useful for this, there's no denying Facebook's convenience and popularity.</p>
<p>I think it'd probably be a good idea for me to install some admin other than myself though, just in case I get trigger happy while aiming at my feet again.</p>
<p>Oh, and I <em>am</em> working on some new music by the way too, if I may self-consciously steer this post towards something a little more newsworthy. More details to come soon (demo track deleted from post).</p>
