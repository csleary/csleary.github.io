<p><a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/EarlyLearning_fnl_1000-300x300.png" alt="Download 'Early Learning' on Bandcamp" title="Download 'Early Learning' on Bandcamp" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1248" /></a>I'd been planning to re-release these tracks properly for a while now, to give them the conclusive send-off they deserve. Thanks to the help of some friends, plus some professional mastering, I can happily announce that <em>Early Learning</em> is now available for a name-your-price <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning">download on Bandcamp</a>! (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/early-learning/id454545599">iTunes</a> etc. will follow over the forthcoming weeks.)</p>
<p>Although all the tracks have been previously released online in one form or another in the past, to collate and properly sequence them, give them a polish and adorn with some great <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/early-learning">nkurence</a>-penned artwork, has breathed new life into them.</p>
<p><em>Early Learning</em> constitutes most of my pre-'Midsummer' output from between 2001 and 2003, and in some cases required revisiting the Cubase VST 5 song files, to be remixed and re-rendered for a cohesive release (i.e. tracks 1, 3 &amp; 9). Being a download-only album, it seemed like a good opportunity to encode the FLACs in 24-bit, exceeding the 16-bit sound quality typical of a CD-borne album. (Which reminds me, I can also upgrade the FLAC editions of 'Like Dust', <em>Lemodie</em> and 'Midsummer' with 24-bit FLACs too. Shall arrange this when I get the chance.)</p>
<p>I've also taken full advantage of Bandcamp's bonus-bundling capabilities, uploading a couple of extra tracks (a remastered 'Bipolar Bears', plus my Zelda remix), in addition to Chris Larkee's video for 'Esign'. The Esign video has been updated with the remastered audio, and rendered to a 720p H.264/MPEG-4 video file.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
