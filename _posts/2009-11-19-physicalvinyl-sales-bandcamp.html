<p>If you've been following Bandcamp's Twitter/blog updates you'll have probably noticed a rather major update: the ability to sell physical products alongside your downloads. Needless to say, I sorted out a bundle for my remaining Midsummer Nice Dream vinyl, pairing up the <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/a-midsummer-nice-dream">double vinyl and an instant download</a> for the current sale price of Â£5. I'll keep it at that price until next week, so if you were thinking about either purchasing it on FLAC or picking up the vinyl, now's the time to act. Consequently, I'll probably retire the Ochre shop in its current state, and divert traffic to Bandcamp for sales.</p>
<p>I've also sent some vinyl to <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/Ochre1">CD Baby</a>, enabling stateside fans to get a better deal on shipping than ordering from me, although at the current sale price it's probably still cheaper to buy direct.</p>
