<p>Now that I'm back in the land of music-making after a summer of ridiculous humidity, pink flamingos and pastel-coloured houses (guess where?), I've re-opened my <a href="http://ochremusic.com/shop/">shop</a> and resumed <a href="http://ochremusic.com/mastering/">mastering</a>. Current mastering rates: £12 per track (plus £12 for CD compilation). Current shop inventory: double AMND 12" vinyl for £10 (CDs now sold out). As ever, if there's anything you'd like to see in the shop (more CDs etc.), I'll try and make plans for it.</p>
<p>I now have a new website for the mastering side of things, too: <a href="http://melograf.com/">Melograf Mastering</a>!</p>
<p>Also added a nice new album review from <a href="http://ochremusic.com/press/reviews-like-dust-of-the-balance/#tmf">The Milk Factory</a>.</p>
