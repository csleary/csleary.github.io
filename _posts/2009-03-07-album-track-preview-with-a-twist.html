<p>The track is 'Lunar Suburbia,' taken from the next Ochre album, 'Like Dust of the Balance,' playing through an old hard disk soldered up to the headphone outputs of my sound card.</p>
<p>Yep, it sounds terrible. But looking at the little drive head vibrate and bob in time with the music perhaps redeems it a little.</p>
<p>If you fancy making your own hard disk speaker, there are a few articles dotted around the net documenting the process, step-by-step, such as the one at the ever-handy <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hard-Drive-Speaker-System/">Instructables</a>.</p>
