<p>Designer <a href="http://nkurence.com">Nate Reeves</a> has knocked up a very cool intricate and flowing Ochre logo, which he then sent to a bespoke engraving outfit to produce a very tasty 3D laser-engraved skateboard deck, with the detailed Ochre logo embossed across it. How cool is that? Talk about a unique artefact. Along with the Ochre logo, he sent a couple of other designs along with it for the same treatment, such as his artwork for <a href="http://naritarecords.com/">Narita</a>'s final <em>Terminal</em> compilation, and a third design of his own.</p>
