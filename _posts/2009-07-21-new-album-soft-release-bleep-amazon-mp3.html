<p>That is a legitimate term, isn't it? Soft-release? Well the album's out in the sense that it can be exchanged for hard-cash from the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Like-Dust-of-the-Balance/dp/B002I2WRRM/">Amazon mp3</a> and <a href="http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&releaseid=20752">Bleep</a>. If you've already swung by Bleep you've probably noticed that they now keep their lossless catalogue in wav format, rather than FLAC. While this might mean downloads are a little longer (less of a problem these days I guess), it'll also mean greater player compatibility without having to decode anything, which is handy (always a step ahead of the pack, those crafty Bleeplings). Shame lossless still carries a premium over mp3, but I'm sure that'll fall by the wayside eventually.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the CDs, we're now looking at next Monday, unless you pre-ordered from Benbecula, in which case you'll have it this week, I think. As ever, you can stream the whole thing on my music page, or Last.fm.</p>
