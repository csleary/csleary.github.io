<p>The ever-productive Knellotron (Chris Larkee) created a video for my vintage track <em>Esign</em> a while back, and so I thought I'd give it another mention now that I'm here on the new site. Chris created the whole thing from start to finish using nothing but open-source software, and you can read more about the video's history on Chris' blog <a href="http://www.knellotron.com/films/esign">here</a>. I'm pleased to learn that Chris' work hasn't gone unnoticed, and he's managed to bag a well-deserved 'Best Animation Artwork' award at the 2005 Blender Conference, as well as securing screenings at various film festivals. Good job mate!</p>
<p>I've embedded a YouTube-hosted vid below, but if you want a warp-free high quality version with AV timing intact (grr, YouTube!), you can grab a .mov of it from <a href="http://www.knellotron.com">Knellotron.com</a>, or an <a href="http://ia331308.us.archive.org/3/items/ChrisLarkeeEsignEsignmp4/Esign.mp4">mp4</a> and <a href="http://ia331308.us.archive.org/3/items/ChrisLarkeeEsignEsignmp4/Esign.mpeg">DVD quality mpeg</a> from archive.org.</p>

<p>The audio track itself was created using Ross Bencina's <a href="http://www.audiomulch.com">Audiomulch</a> program, while it was still in its freeware beta stage.</p>
