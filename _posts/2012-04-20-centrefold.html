<p>I recently completed composing the soundtrack and sound design for <em>Centrefold</em>, a short animated documentary about labiaplasty. The film illustrates the personal accounts, hopes and fears, of three women following their decisions to undergo surgery. Here's the trailer:</p>
<p>http://vimeo.com/39853915</p>
<p>During the project I familiarised myself with <a href="http://www.camelaudio.com/">Camel Audio</a>'s excellent <em>Alchemy</em> synth, so you can expect to hear some evolving synth drones and sample-mangling pads in the score. <a href="http://www.imperfectsamples.com/">Imperfect Samples</a>' warm <em>Braunschweig</em> piano sample library also came in very handy, affording me the kind of warm, intimate piano chords that I can't seem to get enough of lately.</p>
<p>It was also superb fun being able to get my hands dirty handling the sound design for the film. Plenty of fabric-rustling, cutlery-clinking, field recording shenanigans involved, including the implementation of sophisticated GLOVEBIRDâ„¢ technology.</p>
<p>The full film's due for launch this summer, following its tour of film festivals.</p>
<p>You can visit the official Centrefold site over at: <a href="http://www.thecentrefoldproject.org/">www.thecentrefoldproject.org</a> and take a peek behind the scenes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecentrefoldproject">the official Facebook page</a>.</p>
