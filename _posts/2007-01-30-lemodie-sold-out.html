<p>Apart from <a href="http://amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/B000GCGA4C">residual stock</a> floating about in the odd retailer's inventory, Lemodie has now completely sold out. If you <em>can</em> track down a copy, and have yet to secure one, then act quickly! I'd like to thank everyone who bought a physical copy, reaffirming my faith in music lovers and quelling my fears about the humble CD format. Obviously, if you'd happily make do with an mp3 edition, then there is still plenty of <a href="http://www.bleep.com/?bleep=BEN034CD">mp3</a> stock available. ;) On the other hand, if you're at a complete loss and unable to track down any more physical copies, then sit tight and cross your fingers for a repress.</p>
