<p>Three-odd years and one PhD later, I'm pleased to say that I have another Ochre album due for imminent release. <em>National Ignition</em> will be available for download on the 21st of January 2013, from all the usual download stores (I'll put up direct store links when I get them).</p>
<p>It's available to <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/album/national-ignition">pre-order on Bandcamp now</a>, which will allow you to download the first track immediately (the rest of the album being unlocked on release; you'll receive email notification as soon as it's available). The Bandcamp edition also features a 24-bit lossless FLAC option.</p>
<p>Like <em>Early Learning</em> before it, <em>National Ignition</em> received exquisite design treatment by <a href="http://nkurence.com/">nkurence</a>. The album will remain download-only for the time being, but I'd like to release a vinyl version once funds permit, at the very least to do the artwork justice.</p>
