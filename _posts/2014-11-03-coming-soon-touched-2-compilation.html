<p>It's difficult to believe that almost a year has passed since the first '<a href="https://touched.bandcamp.com/">Touched</a>' album, but the next instalment of this charity compilation is due to arrive on the 28th November. Like the first, all proceeds will go to the Macmillan Cancer Support charity, which aims to provide cancer sufferers with care, support and assistance during and following treatment. Also like the first, a staggering number of artists are involved, though this time the number of participants is more than doubled: there are currently over 250 tracks confirmed for the release, including contributions from personal faves such as Autechre, Brothomstates, Datassette, Plaid, Mr. Projectile and Hecq, to name but a few. I'll have a new track in there too. It's sure to be an immense collection -- there's a full list of the artists involved on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/touchedmusic">Touched Facebook page</a>.</p>
