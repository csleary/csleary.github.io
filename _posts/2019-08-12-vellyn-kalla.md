Earlier in the year I released the _Kalla_ EP under my new _Vellyn_ alias. The EP features four tracks, centred primarily around the sampled and processed use and abuse of a violin, for a palette of pummelling hits, shrieks and growls. It'll make for particularly uneasy listening to anyone who actually plays the instrument.

You can find the EP on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5199HInHTcfmfgTI8cOEAQ), Amazon, Deezer etc.

Here's one of the tracks, 'Rive':
