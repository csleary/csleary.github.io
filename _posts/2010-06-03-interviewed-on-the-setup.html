<p>Yesterday, The Setup kindly published <a href="http://christopher.leary.usesthis.com/">a short interview with me</a>, detailing the gear I use in my daily musical exploits. It's a frank run-down of my minimal setup, what I love and loathe about the various software and equipment I use, plus some wish-list musings. Be sure to check out some of their other interviews, as there are quite a few big-hitters of the geek world on there too.</p>
