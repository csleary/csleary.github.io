<p>This may be old news to anyone following me on SoundCloud or Twitter, but still, I thought I'd make it a bit more official by jotting it in the blog.</p>
<p>I've posted both of these as, to be frank, I've no idea when or even if I'll get another album completed (for now I'm shooting for the summer!). Rather than just sit on a pile of tracks that may or may not see light of day, I've popped them up on SoundCloud. As you can see, they're freely downloadable, so you can enjoy them on your portable players without being tethered to the cloud. I must say, it feels nice to be able to post tracks online for immediate feedback again.</p>
