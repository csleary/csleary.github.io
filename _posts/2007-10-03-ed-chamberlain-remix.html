<p>I've recently polished off a remix of Ed Chamberlain's track 'Styge', available at some point in the hopefully not-too-distant future on <a href="http://baselogic.co.uk">Baselogic Records</a>. You can hear the remix in its entirety in exquisite 22kHz 96kbps nigh-fidelity on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ochre">MySpace</a>. I'm fairly certain when it drops it'll be 12" only.</p>
<p>Also, I've finished uploading decent streaming mp3s of <em>A Midsummer Nice Dream</em> to <a href="http://virb.com/ochre">Virb</a>, so you can preview the album there before buying it, should you feel so inclined, from <a href="http://www.toytronic.com">Toytronic</a> (because as far as I can tell, it's one of the few places left where you can still find it on CD and 12"). After all, you can't buy what you haven't heard, can you?</p>
