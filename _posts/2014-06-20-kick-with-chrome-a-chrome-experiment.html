<p>Here's a fun little project for which I handled the audio. It's a set of three World Cup-themed mini games, comprising <em>Infinite Dribble</em>, <em>Space Kick</em>, and <em>Shootout</em>. You use your phone/tablet as a controller, linked with a Chrome browser session to play (though you can use the phone/tablet as the sole screen, too). You can read a little more about the technical showcase on the <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/kick-dribble-shoot-introducing-kick.html">Chrome Blog</a>.</p>
