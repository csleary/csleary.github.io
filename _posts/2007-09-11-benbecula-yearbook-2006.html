<p><em><a href="http://www.benbecula.com/release/various/benbecula_yearbook_2006.shtml">Benbecula Yearbook 2006</a></em> marks the premiere of an annual Benbecula release retrospective compilation, with a bargain price tag of 99p for all twelve tracks! It's a download-only release in association with <a href="http://www.bleep.com">Bleep</a>, featuring the track highlights from albums released last year. The artwork is also available <a href="http://www.benbecula.com/release/various/benbecula_yearbook_2006.shtml">here</a> for download in high-resolution print-quality, so you can make your own CD sleeve/insert, should you wish. <a href="http://www.bleep.com/?bleep=BEN535">Purchase here</a>.</p>
<p>My contribution to the release is 'Bluebottles', from my most recent <em>Lemodie</em> album (<a href="http://www.bleep.com/?bleep=BEN034CD">also available on Bleep</a>, naturally).</p>
