<p>It's that time of year again when the North-East of England sees the biennial <a href="http://www.avfest.co.uk">AV Festival</a> descend upon its streets for a week. Working feverishly over the preceding fortnight, I managed to get involved by writing a piece of music for the festivities being held in Newcastle's <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/culturelab/">Culture Lab</a>, as part of the <a href="http://culturelab.ncl.ac.uk/avfest/">Music & Machines VIII</a> conference. My resulting contribution was a 4.1 9-minute piece called <em>Reception</em>.</p>

<p>This year the symposium shared the AV Festival's theme of <em>Broadcast</em>, featuring a variety of lectures, presentations and interventions by various key writers, artists and musicians. In between the scheduled presentations, artists from Newcastle University presented a series of installations and performance pieces taking inspiration from Jeffrey Sconce's notion of <a href="http://amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/0822325721">Haunted Media</a>, using sample material sourced from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a>'s <em>Pour en finir avec le jugement de Dieu</em>, a recording originally commissioned by Radio France sixty years ago for a broadcast that never was (unsurprising, given the blasphemous and and somewhat scatological subject matter).</p>
<p>Other highlights of the weekend for me were Tao G. Vrhovec Sambolec's <em><a href="http://www.realitysoundtrack.org/index_1.htm">Reality Soundtrack</a></em> and Tetsuo Kogawa's <em><a href="http://anarchy.translocal.jp/">Deconstructing Broadcasting</a></em>.</p>
