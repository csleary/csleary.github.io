<p>Had to hack down a few weeds to reach my poor, neglected blog, and I found an errant pigeon nesting over the 'New Post' button. Actually, the whole site could use a lick of paint, even after ridding it of the various tick-like 'social' icons I'd amassed over these past few years. I'll spruce it up at some point, or at the very least make it more responsive for tablet viewing and such.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a new track for your listening pleasure (or seeing/tasting/ pleasure for the synaesthetes out there, I guess). There's a little blurb about the track itself on SoundCloud, which I needn't duplicate here, but it follows my current ethic of making do with less, or at least trying to do more with less, as far as musical gear and software are concerned.</p>
