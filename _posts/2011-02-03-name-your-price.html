<p>It's well into 2011, and now that they have officially ceased trading, my album contracts with Benbecula Records have expired. As a result, I've kindly had the rights to 'Lemodie' and 'Like Dust' handed back to me, so I've made them both available for download directly from my <a href="http://ochre.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> page (alongside 'Midsummer').</p>
<p>All three albums are downloadable on a 'name your price' basis, currently with no minimum charge, so if you simply feel like swiping them without paying a penny <del datetime="2011-05-01T11:23:36+00:00">or sharing your email address</del>, you're free to do so. Better yet, you can set a price you deem fair for my hard work, and sleep easy knowing you're incentivising future Ochre output. Please spread the word; retweet, share, post etc.</p>
<p>Each full-album download contains a bonus track, with 'Lemodie' and 'Midsummer' having their respective CD 'secret' tracks appended to their tracklist, while 'Like Dust' features 'Threnodie', a track previously released as part of the 'Death of an Aura' EP (which I've now retired).</p>
<p>The expiry of my contracts with Benbecula also means that both albums will start to disappear from third-party download stores. Once all down, I'll set about distributing them through my own digital aggregator (probably <a href="http://www.emubands.com/">Emubands</a>, as they currently handle 'Midsummer' distro).</p>
