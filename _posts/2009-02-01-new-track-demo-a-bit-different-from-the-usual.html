<p>EDIT: Limited-time demo removed.</p>
<p>I've just uploaded a new track demo, following a tentative test-airing on the kind and gentle folks at em411. It's a little different to my usual output, actually containing intelligible vocals, and due to my vocal delivery probably has a slight eighties tinge to it. (That makes it hip, right? Or am I 18 months late to that luminous yellow and pink party?) So far I've been called a Bowie-esque crooner with hint of David Sylvian, Gary Numan '09, and somewhat damningly, Flock of Seagulls.</p>
<p>Dissenters rest assured, I don't plan to abandon instrumental electronica any time soon, but I will say that this was a lot of fun to record. I kind of want to put out a 7" with a couple of synthpoppier tracks on it.</p>
