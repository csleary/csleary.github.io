<p>Regular visitors to the site may have noticed a few changes to the <a href="http://ochremusic.com/music/">music page</a>, with the notable addition of 'Fictional Soundtrack,' eight tracks freely available for download in mp3 and FLAC formats.</p>
<p>These were demo pieces written in 2005 for a fairly well-known Half Life 2 mod called <a href="http://www.hylobatidae.org/minerva/"><em>Minerva</em></a>. It's a very well crafted mod, with a definite style of its own, and a cool, mysterious (i.e. rather cryptic) plot. I originally contacted the author, Adam Foster, and offered these tunes for subsequent episodes, but alas Adam had his music-needs already met. Ah well.</p>
<p>If you have HL2 on your PC, then go and grab Minerva---it's a very worthy free download, and a very challenging extension to the HL2 world. And would you believe it, on the back of the attention garnered by Minerva among the mod community, Adam now <em>works</em> for Valve, developing <em>HL2: Episode 3</em>. Very well-deserved in my opinion---congrats, Adam! That has to be the ultimate fairy tale ending to every mod developer's dream. Hopefully Adam will still have time to add further episodes to Minerva.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the music---this is freely available under a Creative Commons licence, for you to use in your own not-for-profit games, mods, videos etc. If you want anything reworked or tweaked for a particular project, let me know. :)</p>
