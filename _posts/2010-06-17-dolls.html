<p>Hi folks. I've recently started work on a film soundtrack for <em>Dolls</em>, and currently have three pieces written to date, posted below. Feels nice to take off my Ochre hat from time to time, writing music tailored to the requirements of a specific project.</p>
<p><object height="145" width="100%"><param name="movie" value="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fochre%2Fsets%2Fdolls&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=cc3366" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowscriptaccess="always" height="145" src="http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fochre%2Fsets%2Fdolls&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=false&amp;color=cc3366" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%"></embed></object>   <span><a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre/sets/dolls">Dolls</a> by <a href="http://soundcloud.com/ochre">Ochre</a></span></p>
<p>I'll be posting more news as and when it trickles through, but if you'd like to actively stay in the loop with Dolls, we have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=126610437355795">Facebook group</a> to join, as well as a dedicated <a href="http://filmcoalition.co.uk/brighton/blogs/posts/dollsfilm">film blog</a> for your bookmarks. If you're on Twitter, you can also <a href="http://twitter.com/dollsfilm">follow the Dolls team</a> on there, too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm feverishly trying to complete my uni work over the summer, as well as sorting out the next Ochre project. :)</p>
